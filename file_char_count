SRIHARIKOTA: ISRO will undertake placing heavier satellites onboard its geosynchronous launch vehicle in future following the successful launch of an advanced communication satellite on Wednesday, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre Director S Somanath said.
"There is always (scope of) further improvements in GSLV and in the coming GSLV-F10s and F12 missions, we are going to make bigger payload compartment to accommodate still bigger spacecrafts and that is another important challenge in front of us," he said.
He said the scientists were ready for that change and to make sure that the GSLV continues to remain very successful and "rugged" vehicle like ISRO's trusted workhorse, the PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle).ISRO's GSLV-F11, carrying the 2,250kg GSAT-7A, lifted off at 4.10 pm on Wednesday from the second launch pad at Sriharikota, situated about 110 km from Chennai, and placed the communication satellite into its intended orbit about 19 minutes after lift-off.Earlier, referring to the salient features of the GSLV-F11 launch, Mr Somanath said the vehicle was an improved version where scientists brought changes in the cryogenic stage as well as second stage to improve payload capability."This resulted in a lot of engineering changes and new elements. 
The (GSLV) vehicle itself is 1.5 metres longer than the previous GSLVs and it calls for understanding aerodynamics, hardware design and control systems," he said.He congratulated the ISRO team for "meticulously" undertaking all the new changes and making a successful launch."This is sixth consecutive success of the GSLV. 
It only shows that this vehicle is going to stay longer and to make more missions in the years to come with improved capability," he said.
